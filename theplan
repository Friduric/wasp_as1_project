Plan of group B

0. Use general formulations given in material and write some initial code
1. Find parameters for thrust
2. Find parameters for horizontal control xy in view of the simpler pd-controller
3. Find parameter for altitude control
4. Add possibility to add a path or rules for flying between points
5. Add possibility to set yaw direction to fly nose-on towards the reference point
6. Further alternatives: repeated path, more aggressive flying, discrete controller, use vicon positioning system
