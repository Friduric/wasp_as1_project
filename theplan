Plan of group B

0. Use general formulations given in material and write some initial code
1. Find parameters for thrust
2. Find parameters for horizontal control xy in view of the simpler pd-controller
3. Find parameter for altitude control
4. Add possibility to add a path or rules for flying between points
	2018-05-22: Added controls for changing the pid parameters of all pids. Also put a waypoint functionality to go between points. When the point is reached within an euclidian distance the reference point is updated to a point within the waypoint list. The idea is that it should stay at the last waypoint at this stage. /Hector and Emil

5. Add possibility to set yaw direction to fly nose-on towards the reference point
6. Further alternatives: repeated path, more aggressive flying, discrete controller, use vicon positioning system
